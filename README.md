Application Name: Thrify3


Application Description: 
    An online thrift store designed for registered members who are CU students. When a user opens the site, it will direct them to a login page where they can either login to their existing account or click on a register button and be redirected to a register page. For each user, they will be considered a member of the site and will pay a monthly membership fee of $3 a month. 
    Once logged in, the site's home page will be a catalog page where users can search through clothing items based on price, size, and other parameters. Users can add items to a cart and they will be able to access that cart and purchase those items.
    Additionally, users will be able to sell their own pieces. We will have a page were users will list items that are on sale for other users. 
    
    
    
Vision Statement: An accessible, affordable service for CU thrifters to find unique clothing pieces.
